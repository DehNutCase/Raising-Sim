update Mao (Normal)
Mao_Portrait (Normal): What a pretty cauldron.
update Goo (Normal)
Goo_Portrait (Normal): Be careful around it, now. Goo would be quite sad if Goo had to bury another apprentice.
update Mao (Surprised)
Mao_Portrait (Surprised): It's that dangerous?
Goo_Portrait (Normal): Goo follows proper spell safety, and that includes being careful around things that could be dangerous.
Goo_Portrait (Normal): Goo's workshop is safe, but the same can't be said for Goo's apprentices'.
update Mao (Normal)
Mao_Portrait (Normal): Oh. I'll be careful.
- Why are you green?
	Goo_Portrait (Normal): Goo doesn't understand the question.
	Mao_Portrait (Normal): Aren't slimes supposed to be white?
	Goo_Portrait (Normal): Ah. Are you thinking of Dumplings? Goo isn't a Dumpling.
	Goo_Portrait (Normal): Goo is Goo.
	Mao_Portrait (Normal): Oh. Are Goos a type of slime?
	Goo_Portrait (Normal): No. Like Goo said, Goo is Goo. Goo.
	Mao_Portrait (Normal): (I'm completely lost.)

- How did you get your wizarding license?
	Mao_Portrait (Normal): I heard there's a written portion?
	Goo_Portrait (Normal): Goo is literate.
	update Mao [animation="Tada" length="2"]
	update Mao (Blush)
	Mao_Portrait (Blush): No, I mean. Um. *Desperately not pointing out the fact Goo doesn't have hands*
	Mao_Portrait (Blush): Rice, help?
	update Mao (Normal)
	Rice_Portrait (Normal): Minor telekineses is quite simple to learn for anyone magically inclined.
	Mao_Portrait (Normal): So he writes with his mind? Woah.
	Rice_Portrait (Normal): You do realize you also write with your mind, yes? Unless your hand has a separate personality I'm not aware of.
	update Mao [animation="Tada" length="1"]
	update Mao (Excited)
	Mao_Portrait (Excited): Wow! So picking stuff up with my hand is basically telekinesis. I'm magic!

- What are we making today?
	Goo_Portrait (Normal): Goo will be preparing the base for some potions today. Goo's apprentice will watch, learn, and try not to explode, set herself on fire, or otherwise make a mess of things.
	Goo_Portrait (Normal): If you could manage to do nothing at all today, you would be the second best apprentice Goo ever had.
	update Mao (Normal)
	Mao_Portrait (Normal): Okie dokie!
	Mao_Portrait (Normal): (Psst, Rice. Do the things he said usually happen?)
	Rice_Portrait (Normal): (Alchemy and magecraft are both somewhat dangerous by themselves, and moreso when combined. But Goo's a proper wizard, so you wouldn't be in danger even if I weren't here.)
	Mao_Portrait (Normal): Can I take notes?
	Goo_Portrait (Normal): Only if you don't use your wand.
	Mao_Portrait (Normal): Okie dokie. Rice, can I borrow a pen?
