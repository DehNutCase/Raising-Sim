Mao_Portrait (Normal): See you!
Mao_Portrait (Normal): (Psst, Rice. I feel like that girl is in all my classes, is she my stalker or something?)
Rice_Portrait (Normal): She does attend most of your classes, yes. That said, you're the latecomer. If anyone's the stalker, it's you.
Mao_Portrait (Normal): (Oh. Well, is there a place I need to go to report myself? I'm not sure I want to attend the same class as a stalker.)
Rice_Portrait (Normal): Hmm. If you're asking if you can have private tutors instead of attending the academy, I believe her majesty is willing to arrange that for you.
Mao_Portrait (Normal): (I was joking.)
Rice_Portrait (Normal): Moving on. Now that you've attended the class for a bit, do you feel like you learned anything?
Mao_Portrait (Normal): I guess I don't need to whisper any more. Did I learn anything? Hmm.
update Mao [animation="Tada" length="1"]
Mao_Portrait (Normal): I don't know!
Rice_Portrait (Normal): I see.
Mao_Portrait (Normal): Aren't you going to scold me?
Rice_Portrait (Normal): Nothing about your studies is particularly urgent. And it's uncertain if scolding you would help you learn in any case.
update Mao (Excited)
Mao_Portrait (Excited): So I can be lazy all I want and you won't scold me?
Rice_Portrait (Normal): I believe I have already said that was the case.
update Mao (Normal)
Mao_Portrait (Normal): You should play along with me some times, you know?
