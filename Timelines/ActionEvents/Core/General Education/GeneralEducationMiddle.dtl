Mao_Portrait (Normal): Is Victoria not here today? She usually comes to class early.
Rice_Portrait (Normal): She requested a leave of absence today.
do Player.play_voice("disappointed")
Mao_Portrait (Normal): Aww, I wanted to bother her.
do Player.play_voice("huh?")
Mao_Portrait (Normal): Wait, why do you know that anyway?
Rice_Portrait (Normal): In order to guide you to the classes with seats available, I have access to the academy's attendance information.
Rice_Portrait (Normal): (Strictly speaking, I have the access clearance regardless. But that's neither here nor there.)

Mao_Portrait (Excited): Oh wow! Is this the power of royal authority?

Rice_Portrait (Normal): No.
update Mao (Normal)
do Player.play_voice("disappointed")
Mao_Portrait (Normal): Aww.
do Player.play_voice("hmm")
Mao_Portrait (Normal): So do you have any tips for me? I don't feel like I'm getting smarter at all.
Rice_Portrait (Normal): In the first place, getting educated isn't the same as becoming smarter.
Rice_Portrait (Normal): That said, slow and steady efforts apply to everything. From what I see, you're doing fine.
do Player.play_voice("laugh")
Mao_Portrait (Normal): Teehee.
Rice_Portrait (Normal): As for advice, hmm...
Rice_Portrait (Normal): Personally, I don't think it's good to overwork yourself, but you can consider attending cram school if you want to speed through your courses. You'll have to pay for the classes there, however.
do Player.play_voice("huh?")
Mao_Portrait (Normal): Why do you call it cram school when it's just school? And why do I have to pay, anyway?
Rice_Portrait (Normal): You should ask her majesty about that. But it's better not to overthink it.
do Player.play_voice("un_yeah")
Mao_Portrait (Normal): Okie dokie.
update Mao [animation="Tada" length="1"]

Mao_Portrait (Normal): Oh, right! I should text Stella and ask if I should take notes for them.

Mao_Portrait (Normal): [Should üñåÔ∏è take üìñ for you guys? ü´†]
Stella_Portrait (Frown): Why are you texting me when we're in the same classroom? Thanks for the thought, but I'll be taking notes as usual today.
do Player.play_sound_effect("ping")
Mao_Portrait (Normal): [Okie dokie!ü´†üôÉü´†]

Mao_Portrait (Normal): Teehee.
