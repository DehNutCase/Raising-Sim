Mao_Portrait (Surprised): Why is there a classroom here?
Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): It's not a classroom! This is Hiyori's Corner, a helpful hideout that provides facts and tips to the lost and confused.
Mao_Portrait (EyesClosed): (I might as well play along.)
do Player.play_voice("un_yeah")
Mao_Portrait (Normal): Then do you have any tips for me?
Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): Of course! Since this is your first visit here, I'll start with something basic. Did you know ScholarshipðŸ“– increases how fast your stats go up?
Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): The fastest way to increase Scholarship is the General Education class, but you can also try working as a tutor.
Hiyori_Portrait (Smile): That's all for this time's consultation, we hope to see you again.
