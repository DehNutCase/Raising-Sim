Hiyori_Portrait (Surprised): Mao? What are you doing here?
do Player.play_voice("hmm")
Mao_Portrait (Normal): Didn't you say I could come take a look?
Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): I said the exact opposite of that, actually. But welcome.
update Mao (Excited)
do Player.play_voice("yay!")
Mao_Portrait (Excited): Yay! So is there anything you've been working on recently?
update Mao (Normal)
Hiyori_Portrait (Surprised): Well there's this, I suppose, but it's not really a sculpture.

Mao_Portrait (Smile): Aww.
update Mao (Excited)
do Player.play_voice("really?")
Mao_Portrait (Excited): Can I pet it?
Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): Sure, but it's just a golem.

Mao_Portrait (Smile): So why were you embarrassed anyway? She's so cute!
Hiyori_Portrait (Surprised): (She?)
update Mao (EyesClosed)
Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): Like I said, this one isn't really a sculpture. It's more like something I cheated out, so it doesn't count.
do Player.play_voice("huh?")
Mao_Portrait (EyesClosed): Cheated?
Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): It's the difference between rolling up your sleeves and working hard to make a painting and waving your brush once to poof into existence. This one is the second kind.
do Player.play_voice("sure")
Mao_Portrait (EyesClosed): There's nothing wrong with that.
update Mao (Smile)
do Player.play_voice("laugh")
Mao_Portrait (Smile): Haha, her fur is so soft.
Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): (Looks like she's having fun. I'll leave her alone for now.)
