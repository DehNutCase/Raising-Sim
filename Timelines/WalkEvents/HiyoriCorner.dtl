# Need to be redone due to game rework
join Hiyori (Desk) 2
Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): Hello, welcome to Hiyori's Corner, the helpful hideout that provides facts and tips to the lost and confused.

Mao_Portrait (Normal): Hello Hiyori.

	Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): (What was the name again? I think it was Gray.)
	Hiyori_Portrait (Surprised): You picked up Gray, right?
	Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): You should get a golem handler's license if you're planning to keep it. You don't absolutely need it, but it's the rules.
	Mao_Portrait (Surprised): Oh, I didn't know that.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): It's not a big deal, really.

Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): So what would you like to learn about today?
- I can't find Rice.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Surprised): Isn't she right next to you?
	Mao_Portrait (Angry): She won't talk to me.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): Hmm... I don't think she's ignoring you to be mean, so you can try visiting her house.
	[signal arg="{"location_flags": {"rice_house": true}}"]
- I'm trying to climb the tower, do you have any advice?
	Hiyori_Portrait (Surprised): Oh yeah, mom did say she bought you some magic cards earlier.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Surprised): Well, I'll go over the basics. First of all, the stats that matter for duels are\: Health Points, Mana Points, Attack, Defense, Resistance, Magic, Skill, Scholarship, Agility.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Surprised): You'll lose the duel when your health goes to zero, and every turn you'll get mana based on your mana points, which you use to play cards.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Surprised): Attack makes you deal more damage per hit, defense means you take less damage, magic gets you more block when you use block cards, and resistance lets you prevent debuffs.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Surprised): Skill affects how many cards you draw at the start of turn, Scholarship determines how many cards you can hold, and Agility affects both, but only for one turn.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): If you want higher level advice you can try asking Rice. Did you know that she's a Ranker?
- How have you been?
	Hiyori_Portrait (Smile): Same as usual. Mom's been getting on my case about my classes lately, but she always does that.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Surprised): Oh, actually, I've been learning sculpting.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Smile): Everything turns out ugly and messed up, but it's been fun.
	Mao_Portrait (Excited): Wow. Can I take a look at them?
	Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): Maybe later, they look really embarassing right now.
	[signal arg="{"location_flags": {"atelier": true}}"]
- I'm having money problems, do you know a good job that pays a lot?
	Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): I don't know if I can call it a job, but there's a reason lots of people end up adventurers. High leveled monsters tend to be worth a lot of money.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Surprised): It's a bit dangerous to go out looking for them, but you have Rice with you so it should be fine.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): You can also try helping out in the kitchen. I heard they're looking for a cook lately, so maybe you'll get a salary bump for working there.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Surprised): But why do you even have money problems? I'm sure mom'll be happy to cover the tuition if you're trying to take classes.
	Mao_Portrait (Blush): Teehee. Um...
	Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): Well, I won't pry. You can try asking mom for some pocket money. Make an appointment later.

- So why is there a classroom here, anyway?
	Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): It's not a classroom! Hiyori's Corner is a helpful hideout that provides facts and tips to the lost and confused.
	Mao_Portrait (Normal): If you say so. Why is Hiyori's Corner here, then?
	Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): I asked one of the maids to build a secret hideout for me, and this is how it ended up.
	Mao_Portrait (EyesClosed): (But why did they make it a classroom?)
- I can't seem to do anything right.
	Mao_Portrait (Sad): I keep messing up my jobs.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): Are you managing stress properly? High stress makes it hard to work. Try taking relaxing walks before doing something hard.
	Mao_Portrait (Blush): Umm...
	[signal arg="{"stats": {"stress": -5}}"]
	Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): Leaving that aside for now, having higher stats also helps a lot. You can do the same thing over and over and it'll get easier even if you keep failing, but that's slow and inefficient.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Surprised): ScholarshipðŸ“– helps you finish your courses faster, and with Rice around I don't think you need to worry about failing them.
	Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): For jobs it's a bit harder to tell what stats you need, there's no hard or fast rule, but you should have a good sense of whether a job is easy or hard from just your intuition.
	Mao_Portrait (Surprised): Really?
	Hiyori_Portrait (Normal): I hope so, anyway.
Hiyori_Portrait (Smile): That's all for this time's consultation, we hope to see you again.
